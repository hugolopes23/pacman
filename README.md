# Project Title: Pacman

# Description of Project:
This project is to create images of pacman that will move randomly thoughout the screen. Once an iamge makes contact with a border
it will change directions.

# How to Run:
To play the game download the repo zip. Once you have the files downloaded open the pacmen.html into your browser.

# Run Roadmap of future improvements:
I would like to add a feature that would allow each image of pacmen bounce off one another.
